1. Upload PDF file
2. Sent Heroku Flask server as Base64 file, Flask save
onto the local server
3a Heroku Flask server will run MainV9(PyTesseract and MyOCR code),
taking in PDF file from the Heroku server. This produces
the CSV file.
3b. (In parallel with 3a.) React client will poll the Flask serve
every second for updates on the file processing. When the Flask server
returns that the process has already completed(which completed CSV
file is already generated), the React client will send RequestFile
packet to Flask. (4)
4. Flask parses the CSV file to JSON. The Flask will then send
the JSON to React client. React client will
process this and change to the #edit page. This CSV file is parsed
as JSON, and converted to the React components, allowing preview.
